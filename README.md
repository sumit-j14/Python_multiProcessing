# Python_multiProcessing
Learning concepts of multiProcessing in python  
# basics  
using multithreading in python we are potentially using just 1 CPU Core which is not at all good  
With MultiProcessing, we can CREATE A BRAND NEW PROCESS ( with new PCB and all process related stuffs )  
# kernel threads  
So now it is responsibility of kernel to manage these new processes using whatever algorithms
# benefits for CPU-Intensive tasks  
basically we are able to utilize all CPU cores of the machine  
#output
